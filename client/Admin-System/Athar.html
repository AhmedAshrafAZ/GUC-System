 <p>
    
    Athar GUC is a developmental non-profitable/non-governmental organization.
We are a new AWG in the GUC.

Mission:

With the aid of the committed volunteering students, we intend to achieve a consistent developmental model to improve the people’s quality of thinking to suit a modern way of living and vitalising the use of their talents and crafts. In addition, we aim to build the social bridges, increase awareness, and share happiness and respect between people.

Vision:

To utilize the energy and potential of GUC students to create sustainable models in the areas of education and economic empowerment, resulting in better living conditions and quality of life in impoverished communities thereby enabling them to engage positively in their greater society.

Our Slogan:

Happiness to share

We intend to achieve this through creating jobs, establishing development models that can be recreated globally and cultivating a base of committed professional volunteering students to increase awareness, build social bridges and share happiness between people.
